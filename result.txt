No.10   Distinctly, the first episode
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.11   Seems fun
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.12   Educational and Relatable
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.13   That wasn't in the manual...
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.14   Does not accurately represent Seinfeld and its legacy but is still an interesting retrospective viewing experience
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.15   Funny, witty and so much ahead of its time
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.16   Worst episode of television I've ever watched

 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.28   That Kramer.
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.29   "The Stakeout" got George just right in his one brief scene and this episode manages to get Kramer just right with his one scene

No.35   "I don't think we're right for each other"
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.36   In this, the only Seinfeld episode whose title does not begin with the word 'The', Kramer conceives the idea of a bake-your-own-pie pizza shop

 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.47   A splendid start for Seinfeld's second season!
 ,  ,  ,  ,

No.50   Nobody likes a kid with a pony
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.51   Best achievement of the second season!
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.52   I appreciate the status of this one as a mild classic of early Seinfeld but I far prefer the season premiere
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.53   Bread
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.54   "Pipe down, chorus boy!"
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.55   One of the really great early Seinfeld episodes...

No.64   The perfect early 'Seinfeld' portrayal of George Costanza, he singlehandedly elevates this episode

 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.66   "But I need the home-bed advantage"
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.67   Ring
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.68   Officer Kramer
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.69   With the exception of one of Kramer's defining moments in the series, I find "The Statue" to be rather un-Seinfeldian in its humour. It doesn't quite work for me
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.70   There are degrees of coincidence.
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.71   Not the best

No.82   Larry David :)

No.83   A disappointment for me personally, especially after "The Revenge" which almost indicated that 'Seinfeld' was finally figuring itself out

 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.88   I hate when Jerry and Elaine get together
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.89   Elements of what make 'Seinfeld' great in the future are present here, but I don't think they come together well here
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.90   One of the first real gems in the series
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.91   Jerry the cable guy
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.92   Yeah
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.93   A real-time treat
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.94   "Where I am?!"
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.95   The best episode yet, a huge landmark of both television and the series, and definitely an early classic even if it may not hold up as well as later 'Seinfeld'.
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.96   Table Waiting Anarchy
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.97   Gang, I feel your pain.

 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.104   Fire
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.105   "I think it moved."
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.106   This season three premiere immediately puts the series into a higher gear. This is more like the 'Seinfeld' I know and love!

No.107   Season 3 Kicks Off in high gear!

No.115   Good
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.116   Pure, irresistible nonsense
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.117   The show's only episode without both Kramer and George is still an early classic, courtesy of Larry David's fantastic script
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.118   A Trip to Some Stifleing Paradise
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.119   Pen
 ,  ,  ,  , 

No.120   This episode founded the classic Seinfeld fictitious film, 'Prognosis Negative' and for that alone it's worth it. Even beyond that, I find this episode gets a bad rep.

No.121   Weakest episode of the series, but it has redeeming qualities
