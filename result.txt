No.1   Quite the stage setter.
No.2   Not great by the show's standards, but still one hell of a pilot.
No.3   A very good first episode
No.4   Let the fun begin!
No.5   Surprisingly poor start to television's greatest show
No.6   Let the fun begin!
No.7   Hilarious, but
No.8   First Seinfeld Experience... somewhat solid
No.9   And that's the end of that story
No.10   Distinctly, the first episode
No.11   Seems fun
No.12   Educational and Relatable
No.13   That wasn't in the manual...
No.14   Does not accurately represent Seinfeld and its legacy but is still an interesting retrospective viewing experience
No.15   Funny, witty and so much ahead of its time
No.16   Worst episode of television I've ever watched
No.17   The start of it all
No.18   "Art Core... velay"
No.19   What's wrong with Lonnie Anderson?

No.24   Lovby
No.25   Brilliant, just brilliant!
No.26   Best episode of the season
No.27   What's The Rent?
No.28   That Kramer.
No.29   "The Stakeout" got George just right in his one brief scene and this episode manages to get Kramer just right with his one scene
No.30   Sweet episode
No.31   Stuff
No.32   Thought-Provoking Commentary
No.33   Almost painful to watch
No.34   The one with no "The" at the beginning...
No.35   "I don't think we're right for each other"
No.36   In this, the only Seinfeld episode whose title does not begin with the word 'The', Kramer conceives the idea of a bake-your-own-pie pizza shop
No.37   Ha
No.38   Immersive
No.39   Heteronormativity, sexism and gender norms
No.40   Alongside the pilot, this is actually my least favourite episode of the first season
No.41   Season 1 finale: excellent!
No.42   The Stock Is Down Again?
No.43   Woh
No.44   Uncanny Valley Realism
No.45   This is more like the Seinfeld I know and love

No.54   "Pipe down, chorus boy!"
No.55   One of the really great early Seinfeld episodes...
No.56   My Favorite Episode

No.60   "The idiot's on!"
No.61   "Take it easy"
No.62   "i dont like cofee"
No.63   Beep
No.64   The perfect early 'Seinfeld' portrayal of George Costanza, he singlehandedly elevates this episode
No.65   "You have no idea what an idiot is"
No.66   "But I need the home-bed advantage"
No.67   Ring
No.68   Officer Kramer
No.69   With the exception of one of Kramer's defining moments in the series, I find "The Statue" to be rather un-Seinfeldian in its humour. It doesn't quite work for me
No.70   There are degrees of coincidence.
No.71   Not the best
No.72   Agree with the poster regarding Rava's accent
No.73   Sloppy acting
No.74   Classic

No.78   One of the best of season 2.
No.79   "I think I'm having a heart attack!"
No.80   "My name is Bob!"
No.81   "There's Nothing Funny About That!"
No.82   Larry David :)
No.83   A disappointment for me personally, especially after "The Revenge" which almost indicated that 'Seinfeld' was finally figuring itself out
No.84   He
No.85   "This" is very good
No.86   "No. You see? You got greedy"
No.87   George
No.88   I hate when Jerry and Elaine get together
No.89   Elements of what make 'Seinfeld' great in the future are present here, but I don't think they come together well here
No.90   One of the first real gems in the series
No.91   Jerry the cable guy
No.92   Yeah
No.93   A real-time treat
No.94   "Where I am?!"
No.95   The best episode yet, a huge landmark of both television and the series, and definitely an early classic even if it may not hold up as well as later 'Seinfeld'.
No.96   Table Waiting Anarchy
No.97   Gang, I feel your pain.
No.98   Not nearly a great show
No.99   Next
No.100   It's alright
No.101   THE Elaine episode of Season 2
No.102   The busboy's coming
No.103   George's unintentionally harmful remark gets a busboy fired and Elaine dates a guy she hates for no good reason

No.105   "I think it moved."
No.106   This season three premiere immediately puts the series into a higher gear. This is more like the 'Seinfeld' I know and love!
No.107   Season 3 Kicks Off in high gear!
No.108   Getting it right
No.109   It moved
No.110   Still wallowing at this early stage
No.111   "Pity is very underrated"
No.112   "I saw her naked"
No.113   Pappy eh mash eh, eh?
No.114   George Costanza is the highlight in this tightly plotted and highly entertaining early season three episode
No.115   Good
No.116   Pure, irresistible nonsense
No.117   The show's only episode without both Kramer and George is still an early classic, courtesy of Larry David's fantastic script
No.118   A Trip to Some Stifleing Paradise
No.119   Pen
No.120   This episode founded the classic Seinfeld fictitious film, 'Prognosis Negative' and for that alone it's worth it. Even beyond that, I find this episode gets a bad rep.
No.121   Weakest episode of the series, but it has redeeming qualities
No.122   Brilliant
No.123   In-Jokes Run Leashless
No.124   Ruff
